  <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong></li>
    -I utilized Python to proficiently scrape essential data from a targeted website. This involved retrieving specific details about Canada's top revenue-generating companies. Website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_Canada
  <li><strong>Data Organization and Structuring:</strong></li>
    -I applied my skills in data management by utilizing the <strong>Pandas library</strong> to structure and arrange the scraped data into a well-organized DataFrame. This step was pivotal in ensuring that the information was easily accessible and ready for analysis.
  <li><strong>Data Export:</strong></li>
    -After successfully collecting and structuring the data, I implemented a data export mechanism to save the information into a CSV file. This practice is essential for maintaining data integrity and making it readily available for further analysis or future reference.
